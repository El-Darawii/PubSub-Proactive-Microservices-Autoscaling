# EuroSys'24 load testing Reproduction - Stochastic Load Generation for Microservices Autoscaling

## Project Overview
I am implementing a high-academic-integrity reproduction of the stochastic load generation methodology from the EuroSys'24 paper "Erlang: Application-Aware Autoscaling for Cloud Microservices" for the Sock Shop microservices demo. that you can ind inside pubsub proactive microservices autoscaling/ microservice-demo folder


you have to understand the sock shop project accurately and the load testing implementation in details very well

my Core Objective is Reproduce the paper's load testing methodology with maximum academic integrity to study microservices autoscaling under realistic stochastic traffic patterns.

## EuroSys'24 Paper Methodology (Strictly Followed)

### Core Principles
- **Purely Stochastic**: Each user independently selects ONE random action every ~2 seconds
- **Fixed Timeout**: 2-second client-side timeout on ALL requests (mimics user bouncing)
- **Benchmark-Based Weights**: Action distribution from real 2024-2025 e-commerce data  this is very very very important

### Data-Driven Action Distribution
```
Total Weight: 117 tasks
├── Browsing Actions: 85 (88.0%)
│   ├── browse_home: 25 (21.4%)
│   ├── browse_catalogue: 20 (17.1%)
│   ├── browse_category: 20 (17.1%)
│   └── view_item: 20 (17.1%)
├── add_to_cart: 10 (8.5%) ← Dynamic Yield 6.23%, Smart Insights 10.9%
├── view_cart: 8 (6.8%)
└── checkout: 4 (3.4%) ← Dynamic Yield 2.95%, Enhencer 3.76%
```

### Benchmark Citations this is very important to follow
- **Dynamic Yield (2024)**: 6.23% add-to-cart, 2.95% conversion
- **Smart Insights (2024)**: 10.9% add-to-cart rate
- **Enhencer (2025)**: 3.76% conversion rate
- **Baymard Institute (2024)**: 70.19% cart abandonment

## Four Load Patterns

### 1. ConstantLoad
- **Purpose**: Baseline steady-state traffic
- **Configuration**: 50 users for 10 minutes
- **Use Case**: Baseline performance measurement

### 2. StepLoad  
- **Purpose**: Sudden traffic variations
- **Pattern**: 50→200→100→300→50 users at 2,4,6,8 minutes
- **Use Case**: Autoscaling response to bursts

### 3. SpikeLoad
- **Purpose**: Flash crowd traffic
- **Pattern**: Base 10 users with 30s spikes at 1,3,5,7 minutes
- **Peak Users**: 15, 50, 100, 25
- **Use Case**: Flash crowd handling

### 4. RampLoad
- **Purpose**: Organic traffic growth
- **Pattern**: 10→150→10 users over 10 minutes
- **Phases**: 5min ramp up, 2min peak, 3min ramp down
- **Use Case**: Organic scaling behavior
## Usage Commands
```bash
# Four patterns with automatic EuroSys'24 parameters
python scripts/run_load_test.py --pattern constant  # 50 users, 10 min
python scripts/run_load_test.py --pattern step      # Step variations
python scripts/run_load_test.py --pattern spike     # Flash crowds
python scripts/run_load_test.py --pattern ramp      # Organic growth

# Academic Integrity Statement
This implementation shoul strictly adheres to the EuroSys'24 paper methodology . All action weights, timing intervals, and behavioral patterns are must be derived from cited academic and industry benchmarks. The stochastic load generation preserves the paper's core contribution: realistic, data-driven microservices load testing for autoscaling research.
